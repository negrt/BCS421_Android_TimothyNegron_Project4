# App Name: Bank Accounts

An Android OS application that gives you the ability to check the information on the bank accounts as well as

# What I Learned

* Use a data singleton to store data
* Use a recyclerview to display a list of names
* Use only fragments to display all content
* Update recyclerview when a data is added
